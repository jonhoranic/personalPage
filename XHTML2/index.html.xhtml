                    <p>I am a big fan of costume and prop making, and in my free time I do DIY projects to make replicas of peices seen in nerd culture. The above image is the scale design print for the small version of a magical staff seen in the Marvel Avengers movie. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhOfcoBxI80">This scene</a> should help better illustrate what it should look like.</p><br/>
                    <p>There is also a small story behind this specific project choice. I love the Marvel movies as much as the next guy, but I happen to know a girl who is really invested with this cinimatic universe. Her favorite chracter is Loki, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1089991/">Tom Hiddleston.</a> So my reasoning for makeing this should be obvious now.</p><br/>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Many referance images and stills were taken from the movie and from set images of Hiddleston and the staff for scale. (See Referance tab.)</li>
                        <!--Any markers I put in are just for the visuals, I am still trying to get the multi page aspect to work properly. -->
                        <li>I tend to carve with dried pinewood, it is a softer wood and the grain is easy to follow. However this is just my preferance.</li>
                        <li>A long list of trade tools come into play, everything from hand chizels to paint brushes were needed to complete this prop. (See Tools tab)</li>
                        <li>Resycled parts were also needed along with resin pouring equipement, this was the most tedious part of the process.</li>
                        <li>Paint and sealer. A lot of paint and sealer.</li>
